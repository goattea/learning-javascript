/*
EXERCISE 2.01: Functions

	In this exercise, you will demonstrate your ability to declare and define
	function variables.  According to the MDN Docs: 
	
	"Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A 
	function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure â€” a set of statements that 
	performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a 
	function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some 
	obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, 
	you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it."

	
	Resources to Enhance Your Learning:
		Function Basics: https://javascript.info/function-basics
		Functions in detail on the MDN docs:
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions

	Getting Started:
		Open a new terminal by pressing Ctrl + Shift + ` or by selecting 
		Terminal > New Terminal from the VS Code menu. In the terminal, type the
		following command to run the tests in this file automatically:
		
			npm run test-watch -- 2.01

		Once you are done, you can kill the jest process by typing Q in the 
		terminal.

/* TASK #1
	Define a new function variable named "add" that takes in two numeric parameter
	values and returns the sum of the values added together.
*/

// your code goes here

/* TASK #2
	Define a new function variable named "sayHello" that takes in two parameters.
	The first parameter should be a string called name, and the second paramater 
	should be a number called age.  The function should return a string that
	combines the two inputs such that if name was "John Doe" and age was 15, it 
	would output "Hello, my name is John Doe and I am 15 years old.".
	Your function should throw an error if the first parameter is not a string or 
	the if the secod parameter is not a number. For help on testing for the 
	data type of a variable, and how to throw an error, check out the following
	resources:
