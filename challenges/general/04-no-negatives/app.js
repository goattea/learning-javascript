CHALLENGE: Create a function that filters out negative numbers
    
	In this challenge, you'll have a function that takes an array as an input
	and returns an array. But if all goes according to plan, it'll remove the
	negative numbers.

	Once you have the basics down, check out the filter method linked in the 
	resources below to learn about another alternative way to filter values
	from an array.
