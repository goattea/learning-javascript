		<h1>Display an Image on the Canvas</h1>
		<p>
			Knowing how to to load an image on the canvas in code is an
			important thing to learn. This challenge will help you understand
			the fundamentals. For this challenge we will be working with the
			"smile_big.png" image in the assets/images folder.
		</p>
		<p>
			The browser needs to know how to find this image, so we need to tell
			it the "path" to the image file itself. There are two types of
			paths,
			<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp">
				relative and absolute</a
			>. A relative path, which is the recommended methodology, tells the
			browser how to get to a file <em>relative</em> to, or from, the page
			you are currently on (this one!).
		</p>
		<p>
			Relative to this page, you would tell the browser to go down three
			directories (you can use dot dot slash to do this, so down three
			would look like this: <code>../../../</code>), and then go into the
			assets directory, and then into the images directory (this would now
			make the path <code>../../../assets/images</code>). Once in the
			correct folder, you would then add on the file name to make the full
			relative path: <code>../../../assets/images/smile_big.png</code>.
			This will be the value that you place in the
			<code>src</code> attribute of your <code>img</code> tag.
		</p>

		<p>
			Add an img tag to the HTML, just below this paragraph tag (you will
			need to edit this HTML file in VS Code to do so). You can learn
			about <code>img</code> tags here:
			<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp">
				HTML Images
			</a>
		</p>

		<!-- Add your img tag here -->

		<p>
			Make sure you give your image a unique ID attribute just like the
			one in the canvas tag below. Something like
			<code>id="smile-image"</code> should work just fine, as there are no
			other elements on this page with that ID.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can prevent your image from displaying on the page by adding a
			style attribute directly to it: <code>style="display: none;"</code>,
			or by adding the "hidden-asset" style class defined in our site.css
			file which will do the same: <code>class="hidden-asset"</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you have your image element defined, it is time to work in the
			JavaScript file in this folder (app.js).
